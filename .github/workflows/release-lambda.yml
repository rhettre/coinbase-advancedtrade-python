# This workflow will build and upload a Python Lambda Layer when a release is created
# The layer is compatible with AWS Lambda Functions using Python 3.9 and x86_64 architecture
# For more information on Lambda Layers, see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html

# Note: This layer is specifically built for Python 3.9 and x86_64 architecture due to the build process.
# If you need layers for different Python versions or architectures, you'll need to modify the build step.
